## What is this?
Battle Dash is an endless runner game for Android. The player is a warrior who is running forever through a land taken over by barbarians. Every so often, the player will be placed in a boss battle. 
These are a major drawing point to this game. The player must act quickly and do what the screen tells the player to do. If they fail to act, they will die and must restart! 
Along the way there will be many collectables to obtain and obstacles to avoid.
